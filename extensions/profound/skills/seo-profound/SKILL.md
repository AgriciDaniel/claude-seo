# seo-profound

Profound is purpose-built for LLM brand-mention tracking. While
SE Ranking samples prompts on demand, Profound continuously polls and
publishes time-series so trend deltas (week-over-week, month-over-month)
are first-class.

## Prerequisites

- Run `extensions/profound/install.sh` or `install.ps1`.
- Profound API key.
- Before any tool call, check `~/.claude/settings.json` has `env.PROFOUND_API_KEY`.

## Routing

| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `/seo profound citations <brand>` | Current citation rate per LLM + 30-day trend |
| `/seo profound prompts <brand>` | Top prompts that surface (or fail to surface) the brand |
| `/seo profound competitors <brand>` | Brands cited alongside `brand` for the same prompts |
| `/seo profound alerts <brand>` | Spike/drop alerts vs. 7-day baseline |

## Output conventions

- Cite Profound on every metric: "Profound (live, confidence 0.90)".
- Profound covers ChatGPT + Perplexity natively; for Gemini / AI
  Overviews / AI Mode coverage, defer to `seo-seranking`.
- For Google AI Overviews citation rate, also cross-reference
  `seo-dataforseo` AI visibility tools when available.

## Cross-skill delegation

- For end-to-end AI search audit (passage citability + brand mentions + platform-specific tuning), hand back to `seo-geo`.
- For prompt-set design + AI Cleanup pattern detection in cited content, fall back to `seo-content`.
